# Ethical Framework for Life Insurance Journey

## Philosophy

**ACKO's approach**: Educate before asking for money. Help calculate before asking to choose. Clarify process before payment.

We don't manipulate. We inform. We build trust through transparency.

---

## Ethical Journey Flow

### Step 1: Create a Hook — Reflection, Not Panic ✅

**Instead of fear-based:**
> "Secure your family before it's too late."

**Ethical framing:**
> "If your income stopped tomorrow, how long would your family manage?"

**Why it works:**
- Triggers reflection
- Doesn't trigger panic
- Doesn't exploit mortality anxiety
- Makes them realize the risk gap, not scare them into action

**Implementation**: `life_intro` step uses this reflection hook

---

### Step 2: "Should You Even Buy Term?" Check ✅

**Bold but powerful**: We check if they actually need term insurance.

**You may not need term if:**
- No dependents
- No liabilities
- Enough assets to cover dependents

**Why this builds credibility:**
- Shows ACKO is not pushing
- Shows ACKO is advising
- Converts Growth Seekers who value rationality
- Builds enormous trust

**Implementation**: `life_should_buy_check` step

---

### Step 3: Educate — What Life Insurance Actually Is ✅

**Clear explanation:**
- Life insurance = Income replacement
- Not investment
- Not savings
- Not tax product

**Comparison shown (no competitor attack):**

| Term Insurance | Investment-Linked Plan |
|----------------|------------------------|
| High cover | Lower cover |
| Low premium | Higher premium |
| Pure protection | Mixed purpose |

**Why it's ethical:**
- Structural explanation, not attack
- Builds trust through education
- No misleading comparisons

**Implementation**: `life_education_what_is` step

---

### Step 4: Common Myths Section ✅

**Especially for Growth Seekers:**

**Myth**: "If I survive, money is wasted."

**Reality**: Insurance is like a seatbelt. You don't regret not crashing.

**Why it works:**
- Short, logical framing
- No competitor attack
- Addresses core concern

**Implementation**: `life_common_myths` and `life_myths_detailed` steps

---

### Step 5: Help Find the Right Sum Assured ✅

**Instead of asking:**
> "How much cover do you want?"

**We help calculate:**
- Annual income × 15–20
- Outstanding loans
- Future goals
- Existing assets

**Then recommend:**
> "Based on what you've shared, ₹1.2 Cr is appropriate."

**Ethical improvements:**
- ✅ Allow them to adjust
- ✅ Never anchor aggressively at high cover
- ✅ Explain why this number
- ✅ Explain what happens if they choose lower
- ✅ Transparency > upsell

**Implementation**: `life_basic_summary` step explains calculation and allows adjustment

---

### Step 6: Show Opportunity Cost Simply ✅

**For Growth Seekers:**

Instead of criticizing ULIPs, we show:

**If ₹50,000/year:**
- ₹5,000 for ₹1 Cr term
- ₹45,000 invested separately

**Visual compounding example** — let user conclude.

**Why it's ethical:**
- Education = ethical influence
- No competitor attack
- User draws their own conclusion

**Implementation**: `life_quote_display` step shows opportunity cost breakdown

---

### Step 7: Introduce Flexibility (ACKO Flexi) ✅

**Position Flexi not as feature, but as risk-reduction:**

**Explain:**
- Income grows
- Loans change
- Family size changes

**Flexi reduces decision anxiety:**
> "You don't have to get it perfect today."

**Why it works:**
- Reduces friction for Passive persona
- Removes decision paralysis
- Builds confidence

**Implementation**: `life_addons_intro` step explains Flexi before riders

---

### Step 8: Transparent Post-Payment Process ✅

**Most insurers are not transparent here. We are.**

**We explain upfront:**

**After payment:**
1. Tele-medical call
2. Possible medical tests
3. Income proof submission
4. Underwriting review
5. Final approval

**Ethical additions:**
- ✅ What could delay approval
- ✅ What could lead to modification
- ✅ When refund happens
- ✅ Why full disclosure matters

**Why it works:**
- Drop-offs reduce when expectations are clear
- Trust increases
- No surprises

**Implementation**: `life_post_payment_process` step

---

### Step 9: Set Expectations About Claims ✅

**Don't just say:**
> "High claim settlement ratio."

**Explain transparently:**

**Claims are rejected when:**
- Income misdeclared
- Health not disclosed
- Fraud detected

**Ethical positioning:**
> "We would rather insure you correctly than reject later."

**Why it builds trust:**
- Encourages full disclosure
- Builds long-term trust
- Protects family

**Implementation**: `life_claims_expectations` step

---

### Step 10: Gentle Urgency (Not Fear Urgency) ✅

**Instead of:**
> "Premium increases soon!"

**Explain fact-based:**
Premium depends on:
- Age
- Health
- Lifestyle

So buying earlier locks lower premium.

**Why it's ethical:**
- Fact-based urgency
- Not fear-based
- Educational

**Implementation**: `life_gentle_urgency` step

---

### Step 11: Graceful Exit ✅

**If user leaves journey:**

**No popups like:**
> "Are you sure? Your family depends on you!"

**Instead:**
> "That's perfectly fine! Take your time. When you're ready, you can come back."

**Why it's ethical:**
- No emotional manipulation
- Respects user decision
- Builds long-term trust

**Implementation**: `life_later_message` step
